        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is David Kellogg, and welcome to my personal website. This site is equal parts blog, playground so I can learn front-end development, and proof of concept that websites can be intelligently designed to promote privacy.</p>
        <p>I am interested in a great many things, but the content you will find on this site won't stray too far from information and cyber- security, design, and privacy. I don't intend to compile any tips or tricks for navigating the online world with your privacy intact—there are enough websites out there with that kind of information—instead, I hope to relay the lessons I learn and the resources I gather in my personal quest for pivacy online. My hope is that the information that lives on this site will be, at the very least, useful.</p>
        <p>Secondarily, this entire website is built by hand. I have done this so as to practice front-end development in a flexible workspace. I have also opted to build everything by hand so as to prove that privacy can be baked into the design of websites. To demonstrate, this website gathers no information about you—not where you come from, not where you go, and not what you do while you're here. Feel free to read this site's <a href="privacy-policy.html" hreflang="en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="noreferrer" target="_self" type="text/html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p>This site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com" hreflang="en" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" rel="external" target="_blank" type="text/html">GitHub Pages</a> (external). I have chosen this platform because it is reputable and free, allows me to adopt an open source philosophy with the creation of this site, and poses a series of unique challenges to tackle.</p>
        <p>I hope you find something on this site that is, at the least, interesting.</p>
